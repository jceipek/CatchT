MBTA Transit App Design

Why should finding the route home/to work require multiple apps?
Why is it so hard to connect routes with real-time tracking data for trains and busses?
Why do apps forget about us as soon as we give them information?

Important Factors:
- Commute Frequency
- Access timeframe (Don't make users navigate through multiple menus or do extra work)
- MBTA/Route Familiarity (First time - don't know any bus/train names and destinations; information in the world vs the head)

Notes
- Most likely route automatically chosen on startup
  - Starting point is probably current location
  - End point selected by dragging or auto-complete typing
  - Convenience over fine-tuning configuration

- Design before Development

- What stop am I at?
- How long will it take for me to arrive?
- I'm on a moving bus. Is it the right one?
